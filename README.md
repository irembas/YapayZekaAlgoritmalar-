# Artificial Intelligence Project Repository
Welcome to this comprehensive repository of projects related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) that have been implemented in Python. The primary focus of these projects is on genetic algorithms and various machine learning models, providing a rich resource for those interested in AI, be it for educational purposes, research, or personal interests.

# Repository Contents:
Genetic Algorithms: These projects leverage genetic algorithms, a bio-inspired method of problem-solving based on principles of evolution such as inheritance, mutation, selection, and crossover. The projects range from simple optimization problems to more complex tasks such as evolving neural networks or feature selection in machine learning.

Machine Learning Algorithms: This section covers a wide range of machine learning models. From simple linear regression to more complex ensemble methods and deep learning models, these projects demonstrate various methods of training models, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning. They can serve as a guide to understand different types of machine learning algorithms, their use-cases, and their implementation.

# Setup and Execution:
Each project is stored in a dedicated folder within this repository. Navigate to the desired project folder.

Each project contains Python .ipynb source code files along with a README file. The README file provides an overview of the project, the problem it aims to solve, and instructions on how to execute the code.

To run the Python code, make sure you have a Python interpreter (Python 3.6 or later) installed on your system. We recommend using kaggle notebook, or any python notebook editor.

Install the required packages using pip: pip install -r requirements.txt. This will install all the necessary libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.

Run the Python script using your preferred Python environment or through the terminal: python script_name.py.

Contribution:
Contributions to this repository are welcomed. If you've implemented a unique solution using AI, especially genetic algorithms or machine learning algorithms, feel free to submit a pull request.

Note:
This repository is primarily an educational resource for those looking to delve into the world of AI and machine learning. It provides practical implementations of key concepts and can be used for academic study, self-learning, or in preparation for technical interviews. Happy learning and coding!
